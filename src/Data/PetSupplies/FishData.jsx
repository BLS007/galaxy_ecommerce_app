        desc : "The Mixed Butterfly Koi is not identified by its colors or pattern, but by their fins. Butterfly Koi have elongated fins that flow through the water, resembling the wings of butterflies. They can come in a variety of colors and patterns, which makes them all the more exciting. Koi can live 25-35 years or more in captivity when properly cared for, and get as large as 3 feet long, so they will need a large space made specifically for koi. They are considered diggers, so use caution when adding plants because they can get uprooted. Use large rocks to help keep the plants anchored down. Feeding many times a day is recommended since they are very active swimmers. Koi are very messy eaters, so be sure to monitor the water quality and perform water changes as needed. They will eat almost any pellet or flake that you offer, but be sure the food has vegetable foods in it. Freshwater food with vegetables will help prevent swim bladder problems.",
